# PySpark Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey learning and working with PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark. It contains code examples, notes, and projects demonstrating various PySpark functionalities and concepts.

## Project Overview

This project covers fundamental PySpark operations, including data manipulation, transformation, analysis, and potentially machine learning tasks. The primary focus is on understanding the core concepts of Spark and how to leverage PySpark for efficient data processing.

### Day-wise Breakdown

* **day-1.ipynb:** 
    - *Initial Commit:* This notebook introduces the basics of PySpark, such as:
        - SparkSession creation and configuration.
        - Loading data from various sources (e.g., CSV, Parquet).
        - Basic DataFrame operations (e.g., select, filter, groupBy).
        - Understanding Spark's lazy evaluation.

* **day-2.ipynb:** 
    - *Column Operation Code Added:* This notebook explores advanced DataFrame manipulations, focusing on:
        - Working with different data types and schemas.
        - Performing complex column operations (e.g., UDFs, string manipulation, date/time functions).
        - Handling missing data (null values).
        - Aggregating data and performing statistical calculations.
        
* **day-3: Handling Missing Values
    - This notebook delves into handling missing values in PySpark DataFrames, covering:
	- Identifying and counting missing values.
	- Dropping rows with missing values.
	- Replacing missing values with mean, median, or mode imputation.
	- Using more advanced imputation techniques (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors).

* **TSLA.csv:**
    - *First Commit:* This dataset (or a similar one) is used for practical examples and demonstrations in the notebooks. It likely contains historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA), allowing for analysis and exploration of time-series data.

### Key Concepts and Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to achieve proficiency in the following areas:

* **Spark Architecture:** Understanding the distributed computing paradigm of Spark, including master/worker nodes, executors, and task scheduling.
* **DataFrames:** Mastering the use of Spark DataFrames for efficient data manipulation and query processing.
* **Transformations and Actions:** Differentiating between transformations (lazy operations) and actions (triggering computations) in Spark.
* **Spark SQL:** Utilizing Spark SQL for querying data with SQL-like syntax.
* **Performance Optimization:** Exploring techniques for optimizing Spark jobs, such as caching, partitioning, and data serialization.
* **Big Data Processing:** Applying PySpark to process and analyze large datasets that cannot fit into memory on a single machine.

### Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

1. **Apache Spark:** Install a compatible version of Apache Spark.
2. **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed, preferably version 3.6 or higher.
